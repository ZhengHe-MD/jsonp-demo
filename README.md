# jsonp-demo
a demo for explaining how does jsonp work

JSONP means 'JSON with Padding' and it is used to circumvent CORS rules implemented
by modern browsers. For details, I recommend the awesome blog - [Exactly What IS JSONP?](https://cameronspear.com/blog/exactly-what-is-jsonp/)

# How to start

1. start [the api server](./index.js)

```sh
$ yarn && npm run dev:start
```

2. open [index.html](./index.html) in the browser manually or with shell command

```sh
$ open index.html
```
